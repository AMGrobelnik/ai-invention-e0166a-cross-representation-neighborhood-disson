## Repository Structure

Each artifact has its own folder with source code and demos:

```
.
├── <artifact_id>/
│   ├── src/                     # Full workspace from execution
│   │   ├── method.py            # Main implementation
│   │   ├── method_out.json      # Full output data
│   │   ├── mini_method_out.json # Mini version (3 examples)
│   │   └── ...                  # All execution artifacts
│   └── demo/                    # Self-contained demos
│       └── method_code_demo.ipynb # Colab-ready notebook (code + data inlined)
├── <another_artifact>/
│   ├── src/
│   └── demo/
├── paper/                       # LaTeX paper and PDF
├── figures/                     # Visualizations
└── README.md
```

## Running Notebooks

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the "Open in Colab" badges above to run notebooks directly in your browser.
No installation required!

### Option 2: Local Jupyter

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AMGrobelnik/ai-invention-e0166a-cross-representation-neighborhood-disson.git
cd ai-invention-e0166a-cross-representation-neighborhood-disson

# Install dependencies
pip install jupyter

# Run any artifact's demo notebook
jupyter notebook exp_001/demo/
```

## Source Code

The original source files are in each artifact's `src/` folder.
These files may have external dependencies - use the demo notebooks for a self-contained experience.

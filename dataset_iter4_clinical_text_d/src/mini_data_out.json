          "input": "Tissue changes around loose prostheses. A canine model to investigate the effects of an antiinflammatory agent. The aseptically loosened prosthesis provided a means for investigating the in vivo and in vitro activity of the cells associated with the loosening process in seven dogs. The cells were isolated and maintained in culture for sufficient periods of time so that their biologic activity could be studied as well as the effect of different agents added to the cells in vivo or in vitro. The biologic response as determined by interleukin-1 and prostaglandin E2 activity paralleled the roentgenographic appearance of loosening and the technetium images and observations made at the time of revision surgery. The correlation between clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure. A canine model permits the study of possible nonsurgical therapeutic interventions with the ultimate hope of stopping or slowing the loosening process.",

Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is the isoform of enolase, a glycolytic enzyme found in the neuroendocrine system. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide recently discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Serum NSE and plasma NPY levels have been reported to be increased in some patients with pheochromocytoma. The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24). However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with elevated NPY levels. These results show that determination of serum NSE may be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign pheochromocytoma; the measurement of plasma NPY is not useful for differentiating the two kinds of tumors.",

          "input": "Sexually transmitted diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The challenge of the nineties. During the past two decades, an explosive growth in both the prevalence and types of sexually transmitted diseases has occurred. Up to 55 percent of homosexual men with anorectal complaints have gonorrhea; 80 percent of the patients with syphilis are homosexuals. Chlamydia is found in 15 percent of asymptomatic homosexual men, and up to one third of homosexuals have active anorectal herpes simplex virus. In addition, a host of parasites, bacterial, viral, and protozoan are all rampant in the homosexual population. Furthermore, the global epidemic of AIDS has produced a plethora of colorectal manifestations. Acute cytomegalovirus ileocolitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in the homosexual AIDS population. Along with cryptosporidia and isospora, the patient may present to the colorectal surgeon with bloody diarrhea and weight loss before the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Other patients may present with colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma or anorectal lymphoma, and consequently will be found to have seropositivity for HIV. However, in addition to these protean manifestations, one third of patients with AIDS consult the colorectal surgeon with either condylomata acuminata, anorectal sepsis, or proctitis before the diagnosis of HIV disease. Although aggressive anorectal surgery is associated with reasonable surgical results in some asymptomatic HIV positive patients, the same procedures in AIDS (symptomatic HIV positive) patients will often be met with disastrous results. It is incumbent upon the surgeon, therefore, to recognize the manifestations of HIV disease and diagnose these conditions accordingly.",

The results of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty of 121 thrombosed hemodialysis grafts were reviewed. The initial pharmacomechanical method (used in 65 cases) employed clot maceration with hook-shaped catheters and clot lacing with highly concentrated urokinase. The current technique (used in 56 cases) consisted of pulsed-spray injection of urokinase into the clot. All fully treated grafts (117 cases) underwent complete or near-complete thrombolysis, and 93% remained patent after 1 day. Mean time for pulsed-spray lysis was 46 minutes +/- 21. One patient (less than 1%) had gastrointestinal bleeding and received a transfusion; minor complications occurred in 3% of patients. Primary and secondary graft patency rates for both methods at 1 year were 26% and 51%, respectively. While graft age and results of angioplasty did not influence future graft patency, shorter intervals between graft thromboses was predictive of earlier subsequent graft failure. Results suggest that pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty provide rapid, consistent, and safe recanalization of clotted hemodialysis grafts and represent a promising additional therapeutic approach to long-term graft management.",

          "input": "Sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension. The differences between sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension were theoretically considered using a water tank model of body fluid volume-blood pressure regulation. If an outlet valve is attached to a tank with a base area corresponding to the reciprocal of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and water is poured into this tank at a rate corresponding to the amount of Na+ intake, then equilibrium should be achieved at a certain water level, volume and output from the outlet, which represent mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and urinary Na+ excretion. The height of the outlet from the tank bottom and the size cross-sectional area, of the outlet correspond to the x-intercept and slope of the renal function (pressure-natriuresis) curve, respectively. In both nonsodium sensitive hypertension, due to the shift of the curve toward a higher blood pressure level (elevated height of the outlet) without change in the slope (size of the outlet), and sodium sensitive hypertension, due to the depressed slope of the curve (reduced outlet size), not only MAP (water level) but also CO (water volume) are increased, resulting in sodium retaining hypertension, if TPR (reciprocal of base area) remained unchanged, while CO is relatively unchanged, resulting in nonsodium retaining hypertension, if TPR is elevated. Thus, the MAP and its sensitivity to sodium intake is determined by the renal function curve. Since body fluid volume is determined by both the renal function curve and TPR, however, changes in TPR during the development of hypertension is a major factor in determining whether or not the body fluid volume has to change only a small amount or a large amount. Therefore, the sodium sensitivity of blood pressure and sodium retention must be considered separately.",

Quantitative two-dimensional (2-D) and Doppler echocardiography were used to determine whether hemodialysis results in alterations in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling that might contribute to dialysis-induced hypotension, as well as to assess whether any hemodynamic variables or indices of diastolic filling might be used to identify which patients were at the greatest risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis. Sixteen male patients undergoing routine maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease were prospectively studied before and after hemodialysis. Following hemodialysis there was a significant prolongation (P less than 0.05) in LV isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), as well as a significant reduction in the rate and extent of early rapid ventricular filling (P less than 0.005); in contrast, late atrial-assisted filling did not change significantly. A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis of predialysis hemodynamic parameters and noninvasive indices of LV filling showed that there was a significant independent inverse relationship between the frequency of dialysis-related hypotensive episodes and the duration of early LV filling (r = -0.81; P less than 0.001). These results suggest that hemodialysis results in discrete alterations in early LV filling, with no significant compensatory increase in late atrial-assisted ventricular filling. Further, patients with the shortest early LV filling times appeared to have the greatest predilection for becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis.",

STUDY QUESTION: Does cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) improve resuscitation rates and limit infarct size after cardiac arrest and acute myocardial infarction? DESIGN: Controlled randomized trial with all animals undergoing left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and subsequent ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation. All animals were supported for four hours after resuscitation in an intensive care setting. INTERVENTION: Group 1 (eight) was resuscitated with standard external CPR and advanced life support. Group 2 (eight) was resuscitated with CPB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group hemodynamic, resuscitation variables, number resuscitated, and number of four-hour survivors were compared. Ischemic and necrotic myocardial weights were determined with histochemical staining techniques in four-hour survivors. Infarct size was measured as the ratio of necrotic weight to ischemic weight. Significantly fewer dogs were resuscitated in group 1 (four of eight) than in group 2 (eight of eight) (P less than .05). Group 2 survivors required significantly less epinephrine and lidocaine than group 1 survivors (P less than .05) and higher aortic diastolic and coronary perfusion pressures after CPB (P less than .001). The ratio of myocardial necrotic weight to ischemic weight at four hours was 0.82 +/- 0.25 in group 1 and 0.22 +/- 0.25 in group 2 (P less than .05). However, collateral blood flow was not measured in this study. CONCLUSION: This pilot study further substantiates the improvement in resuscitation rates obtainable with CPB. CPB may also limit infarct size during the postresuscitation period and requires further study.",

Offspring of hypertensive parents showed a similar but weaker pattern. Both risk groups reported more positive interactions with their parents (genetic risk subjects versus controls, p less than 0.05; borderline hypertensive patients versus controls, p = 0.08) and had higher state-anxiety levels (p less than 0.05). There were more subjective symptoms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated functions (e.g., tachycardia, tremor) in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents, elevated heart rates (analysis of repeated measures, p less than 0.001), and enhanced plasma norepinephrine concentrations (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls.

It is probable that alterations of these substances during central nervous system ischemia are involved in the processes that cause irreversible neural damage. Calcium regulates several protein kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation of proteins vital for many central nervous system functions. Using a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, we found protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase were severely affected during the first hour of ischemia. Protein kinase A was not significantly affected. The time course of lost protein kinase C enzyme activity closely corresponded to irreversible loss of neurologic function, and there is evidence that protein kinase C inhibitor activity is generated. Also, drugs that inhibit protein kinase C increased neurologic damage when administered during the early phases of ischemia. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation, particularly by protein kinase C, is critical to maintenance of neurologic function.",

To explore further the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance observed in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, we studied a 35-year-old woman with presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. After oral glucose ingestion, glucose tolerance remained normal; however, this occurred at the expense of a markedly hyperinsulinemic plasma response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. To examine this question more directly, we performed a stepwise euglycemic insulin clamp study in combination with an infusion of [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate and indirect calorimetry. The ability of insulin to promote total body (primarily muscle) glucose uptake was markedly impaired, whereas its effect to suppress hepatic glucose production was normal compared with results obtained in nine healthy subjects. Moreover, insulin failed to normally suppress plasma free fatty acid turnover and oxidation in this patient. This informative case demonstrates that portal hypertension alone, without hepatic dysfunction from cirrhosis, is associated with impaired insulin-mediated glucose and plasma free fatty acid metabolism and may also play a predominant role in the development of insulin resistance in many cirrhotic patients.",

The study took place in a 12-bed medical respiratory intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital. Twenty-one patients had OLT performed over a 21.5-month period (January 1988 to October 15, 1989) for end stage liver disease (ESLD) from a variety of causes. A flow-directed right heart catheter and an indwelling arterial cannula were inserted for hemodynamic monitoring over a 96-hour postoperative period. Liver and renal function studies, total serum calcium, serum albumin, and fluid balance were determined daily. The SVR increased significantly to 12.8 +/- 0.6 U at 48 hours compared with immediate (less than 8 hours) postoperative levels (p less than 0.05) and remained elevated for 96 hours. The CO fell progressively and was significantly lower than baseline values from 64 to 96 hours. There was significant inverse correlation between the increase in SVR and the fall in CO (r = .85, p less than 0.01). The SBP was stable except for a small, but significant fall at 16 and 24 hours postoperatively. The PWP increased significantly from a baseline value of 12.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg to 15 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at 32 hours and remained elevated through 96 hours (p less than 0.05). The serum bilirubin level fell progressively postoperatively and the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) shortened significantly. Bile flow increased progressively from 107 +/- 120 ml/24 hours at the end of the first 24 hours to 188 +/- 125 ml/24 hours by 96 hours postoperatively. Five patients died from nine to 43 days postoperatively. These patients' hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different from the patients who survived. Successful OLT is associated with a rapid increase in SVR and a fall in CO without changes in SBP. These findings tend to parallel the improvement found in results of liver function tests.

Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection). Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.",

In prosthetic or paravalvular prosthetic mitral regurgitation, transthoracic color Doppler flow mapping can sometimes fail to detect the regurgitant jet within the left atrium because of the shadowing by the prosthetic valve. To overcome this limitation, we assessed the utility of color Doppler visualization of the flow convergence region (FCR) proximal to the regurgitant orifice in 20 consecutive patients with mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation documented by surgery and cardiac catheterization (13 of 20 patients). In addition, we studied 33 patients with normally functioning mitral prostheses. Doppler studies were performed in the apical, subcostal, and parasternal long-axis views. An FCR was detected in 95% (19 of 20) of patients with prosthetic mitral regurgitation. A jet area in the left atrium was detected in 60% (12 of 20) of patients. In 18 of 19 patients with Doppler-detected FCR, the site of the leak was correctly identified by observing the location of the FCR. A trivial jet area was detected in eight patients with a normally functioning mitral prosthesis; in none was an FCR identified. Thus color Doppler visualization of the FCR proximal to the regurgitant orifice is superior to the jet area in the diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Moreover, FCR permits localization of the site of the leak with good accuracy.",

DC shocks within the coronary sinus have been abandoned because of the risk of cardiac rupture and tamponade. Catheter ablation using DC energy to electrodes straddling the ostium of the coronary sinus, when used clinically, has been reported to result in cardiac tamponade in as many as 16% of patients. A new system of energy delivery maximizes voltage while decreasing the undesirable effects caused by barotrauma. This system includes 1) a low-energy ablation power supply with a brief time-constant capacitive discharge that delivers up to 40 J and 3,000 V and 2) a low-energy ablation catheter with a contoured distal electrode. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies of this new system and compared arcing shocks with nonarcing shocks. Ablations were performed using unipolar distal shocks (D) and unipolar shocks to both electrodes made electrically common (P-D). In vitro studies were done in a large tank filled with physiological saline while recording voltage, current, and pressure. High-speed cinematography (32,000 frames/sec) of shocks of 10-40 J permitted detailed analysis of the vapor globe. Anodal shocks of less than 20 J showed no arcing or only minimal vapor globe formation. For D and P-D anodal shocks of 40 J, the diameters of the vapor globe were 31 and 22 mm, respectively, corresponding to pressure recordings of 11 and 4.9 atm. The pressure rise lasted less than 50 mu sec. In vivo studies involved 18 dogs that received nonarcing shocks (one to six shocks of 15 J) and 18 dogs that received arcing shocks (one to three shocks of 40 J). Each group was divided between D and P-D shocks; catheter ablation was performed at a mean +/- SEM distance of 2.94 +/- 0.92 cm within the coronary sinus. All dogs tolerated the procedure without cardiac rupture or tamponade. When killed 2-4 days later, the dogs had edema and hyperemia or hemorrhage in the area of the coronary sinus. We compared the effects of multiple (three to six) nonarcing shocks with the effects of one to three arcing shocks.

Luminal bacteria or their cell wall polymers were implicated in the pathogenesis of the lesions because sham-operated rats and rats with self-emptying blind loops, having only slightly increased bacterial counts, did not develop hepatic injury. In this study, antibiotics with different spectra of activities were continuously administered starting 1 day or 22 days after surgery to determine which intestinal flora may be responsible for the development of hepatic injury in rats with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Four weeks following surgery, Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics had elevated liver histology scores (8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4) and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (269 +/- 171 vs. 84 +/- 24) compared with sham-operated rats, P less than 0.001. Oral gentamicin as well as oral and intraperitoneal polymyxin B, which binds endotoxin, did not prevent hepatic injury in rats with self-filling blind loops. However, oral metronidazole and tetracycline therapy continuously administered beginning 1 day after surgery diminished hepatic injury (histology score 3.0 +/- 1.8, 2.9 +/- 1.1; aspartate aminotransferase 87 +/- 25, 98 +/- 34; respectively P less than 0.001 compared with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics). Metronidazole also protected Wistar rats that require 12 weeks to develop hepatic injury following experimentally induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth compared with rats with self-filling blind loops that received no antibiotic treatment (histology score 10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 1.1, and aspartate aminotransferase 273 +/- 239 vs. 76 +/- 20, P less than 0.001). When rats started metronidazole therapy 22 days after self-filling blind loop surgery, elevated aspartate aminotransferase values decreased to normal during the next 77 days and final histology scores were normal. All rats with self-filling blind loops had negative peritoneal, liver, spleen, and blood cultures but approximately 75% of mesenteric lymph node cultures were positive irrespective of antibiotic treatment. Because Bacteroides species have been implicated in causing vitamin B12 and disaccharidase deficiencies in rats with self-filling blind loops, we documented the presence or absence of these organisms from blind loops using selective culture techniques.

Thirty-five of 122 patients had one or more lymph nodes with frozen-section evaluation positive for metastatic carcinoma. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-section study revealed metastatic carcinoma in two additional patients. The false-negative rate was 1.6%. Sensitivity was 94.6%. Predictive value of negative frozen-section evaluation results was 97.7%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section evaluation were 100%. The statuses of individual lymph nodes from these 122 patients were also evaluated. Six hundred twenty lymph nodes were sampled from the mediastinum at mediastinoscopy. Frozen-sections in 47 lymph nodes were positive. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-sections examination revealed metastatic carcinoma in four additional lymph nodes. The false-negative rate was 0.6%. Sensitivity was 92.2%. Predictive value of negative results from frozen-section evaluation was 99.3%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section examination were 100%. We conclude that frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes at mediastinoscopy reliably indicates lymph node status, thus enabling the physician to decide whether to proceed to thoracotomy.

The Central Netherlands Registry (CNR) of women with vaginal or cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCAC) was established in 1985. An overview is presented of clinical and pathologic data of 55 patients who were registered at the CNR until July 1, 1988. All Netherlands Departments of Pathology (NDP) maintain a patient registry and 95% of the Institutes are connected with a Central Archive via a computer network. The histologic slides and clinical status were reviewed at the CNR. Twenty-five tumors were classified as vaginal carcinoma and 30 as cervical carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 22 years. Fifty-five percent of patients (63% of patients with known maternal history) were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. The majority of cases was initially diagnosed after 1980. Cytologic examination before the initial histologic diagnosis indicated that cervical tumors were detected in 80% of cases, but vaginal tumors were detected only in 33% of cases. It was concluded that an examination of DES-exposed women should consist of colposcopic inspection of the cervix and vagina, cytologic examination of the cervix and four quadrants of the vagina, and careful palpation of the cervix and the entire vaginal wall. The most important prognostic parameter for patients with CCAC was stage and grade of nuclear atypia. The results of a statistical analysis showed that these features were the most effective to distinguish between nonsurvivors and patients surviving more than 5 years.",

The identification of carotid restenosis as an unexpected late complication of carotid endarterectomy has prompted concerns regarding its importance as a source of new cerebral symptoms, stroke, and death. To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a consecutive series of 507 patients undergoing 566 carotid endarterectomies, each documented as technically satisfactory. Post-operative duplex Doppler examination data at 3 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter in 484 arteries (85.5%) permitted classification of these arteries according to the most severe degree of postoperative stenosis: normal (n = 306); 1% to 19% (n = 89); 20% to 50% (n = 40); more than 50% (n = 49, including 8 occluded). The incidence of more than 50% restenosis was 14.5% in female and 7.7% in male patients (p = 0.003). Life table analyses to 10 years revealed a significantly greater life expectancy among those with restenosis (p = 0.05). Stroke was also less likely in patients with restenosis, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. When survival and stroke were both endpoints, the likelihood of patients with more than 50% restenosis remaining alive and stroke free was also greater than the less than 20% stenotic group (p = 0.03). Thus patients with carotid restenosis were less likely than patients with normal postoperative scans to have late symptoms, stroke, or early death.",

Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy. Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients. In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed, suggesting that, for lactulose at least, these effects are mediated by the gut flora. Measurement of the alpha-, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria. The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that, from the perspective of protein metabolism, lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.",

The ability to share time and to shift attention between bimanual simultaneous motor tasks were studied in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 19 age- and intelligence-matched controls. The task consisted of drawing triangles with the dominant hand and squeezing a rubber bulb with the nondominant hand. Motor performance was measured using the variables: amplitude of squeezing, frequency of squeezing and velocity of drawing triangles. After eliminating variance due to baseline differences in single-handed performance, the bimanual simultaneous performance of PD and controls turned out to be similar to the frequency of squeezing and the velocity of drawing triangles. The amplitude of squeezing, however, differed between the two groups: it was significantly reduced in PD. Arguably the disturbance in the bimanual performance of PD patients was not due to a disorder of time sharing, but to a decreased ability to shift attention from the visually cued task to the non visually cued task. The results agree with current evidence that PD patients are more impaired when they have to rely upon internal control for the regulation of shifting attention than when external cues are available.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in elderly patients in institutions providing different levels of care. DESIGN: Prevalence study. SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital. PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion. A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged). All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS). RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%). The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care. When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions.",

A clinical lesion study and intraoperative epidural recordings were made to test the origin and clinical significance of the spinal N13 and P13 of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) that follow median nerve stimulation. Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity. On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor. The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13. Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome. This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn. Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage.",

Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons. In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex. In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery. Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6. Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing. After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb. Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing. In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery. Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits. The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection. These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage.",

This study evaluates the positional relationship of the disc and mandibular condyle in patients with late opening clicks treated with appliance therapy. A total of 30 joints (18 patients) were studied. Twenty-seven of these 30 joints were treated with the appliance until the joints were silent to auscultation. The patients were then evaluated with axial corrected tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the centric occlusion position and with their bite appliance (Sved-type) in place. Comparisons were made between condyle position in centric occlusion and with the appliance in place. Magnetic resonance imaging was then used to evaluate disc positional changes. Each imaging procedure was made in the same sagittal plane. Only changes in condyle positioning could be identified. Evidence of disc repositioning with the appliance in place was seen in only three MRI examinations. The remaining 27 joints continued to exhibit disc displacement with various changes in disc morphology. It is concluded that the concept of \"disc capture\" is a clinical term only, and that such perceived clinical success should not lead to the assumption that an actual change in intra-articular anatomic relationships has occurred. Joint noises may decrease because joint space is increased, allowing smoother condylar translation beyond disc surface irregularities and positional abnormalities.",

  "title": "CRND Novelty Gap",
  "summary": "Comprehensive 7-step literature survey across instance-level data complexity, cross-representation comparison, and neighbor-based noise detection confirms CRND occupies a unique position at the intersection of 5 criteria: per-instance, cross-representation, neighborhood-based, unsupervised, and model-agnostic diagnostics. No existing method among 20+ surveyed combines all five. WANN (closest competitor) operates in a single embedding space. Schoener's D has never been applied to ML class overlap, confirming genuine cross-domain transfer novelty. Top 4 baselines identified: WANN eta, Smith et al. kDN, Dataset Cartography, cleanlab.",
  "answer": "## CRND Novelty Gap Survey: Comprehensive Literature Analysis\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis survey rigorously examines three established research streams — instance-level data complexity measures, cross-representation comparison methods, and neighbor-based label noise detection — to validate whether Cross-Representation Neighborhood Dissonance (CRND) fills a genuine novelty gap. After analyzing 20+ methods across these streams, the conclusion is clear: **no existing method combines per-instance granularity, cross-representation comparison, neighborhood-based analysis, unsupervised operation, and model-agnostic design**. CRND's unique conjunction of all five properties is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Stream 1: Instance-Level Data Complexity Measures\n\n#### Ho & Basu (2002) — Foundational Neighborhood Complexity\n\nHo and Basu introduced the foundational complexity measures for classification problems, grouping them into three categories: (i) measures of overlap of individual feature values, (ii) measures of class separability, and (iii) geometry, topology and density measures [1]. Their neighborhood measures N1 (fraction of points on the class boundary), N2 (ratio of intra/inter class nearest neighbor distance), and N3 (error rate of 1-NN classifier) operate at the **dataset level** in a **single feature space** [1]. While N1 can reveal difficulty at the instance level by identifying boundary points, it does so within one representation only. **CRND gap: No cross-representation comparison; primarily global metrics.**\n\n#### Smith et al. (2014) — Instance Hardness and kDN\n\nSmith et al. introduced the concept of instance hardness as the likelihood each observation has of being misclassified [2]. Their kDN (k-Disagreeing Neighbors) metric estimates local overlap by computing the percentage of an instance's k nearest neighbors that do not share its label [2]. Crucially, Smith et al. vary **classifiers** (different learning algorithms) on the **same features** to compute cross-validation-based instance hardness [2]. This is fundamentally different from CRND, which varies **feature representations** while using the **same algorithm** (k-NN). kDN operates in a single feature space and produces a per-instance hardness score, making it a strong but incomplete baseline. **CRND gap: Single feature space; varies algorithms, not representations.**\n\n#### Lorena et al. (2019) — Comprehensive Survey\n\nThe most comprehensive survey of data complexity measures groups them into feature-based, linearity, neighborhood, network, dimensionality, balance, and overlap categories [3]. The survey covers measures from Ho & Basu through modern decomposed approaches. Critically, a grep of the full PDF for ecological metrics (Schoener, niche, Broennimann) returned **zero matches** [3]. The Hellinger distance is mentioned only in the context of Zubek and Plewczynski (2016) complexity curves, not ecological niche overlap [3]. **No cross-representation measures exist in this taxonomy.** All neighborhood measures (N1-N4, T1, LSC) operate in a single feature space.\n\n#### Arruda et al. (2020) — Decomposed Per-Instance Complexity\n\nArruda et al. decomposed dataset-level complexity measures at the instance level, providing a perspective of how each individual example contributes to overall complexity [4]. Their PyHard tool generates hardness embeddings for interactive visualization [4]. While this achieves per-instance granularity, it operates entirely within a single feature representation. **CRND gap: Single feature space; no cross-representation analysis.**\n\n#### Santos et al. (2022) — Class Overlap Survey (Information Fusion)\n\nThe most comprehensive class overlap survey establishes a novel taxonomy covering feature, instance, structural, and multiresolution overlap [5]. A grep of the full 176-page PDF for Schoener, ecological, niche, and cross-representation terms returned **zero matches** [5]. This confirms that ecological niche overlap metrics have never been adopted by the ML class overlap community. **CRND gap: No ecological transfer; no cross-representation overlap measures in the taxonomy.**\n\n---\n\n### Stream 2: Cross-Representation Comparison Methods\n\n#### CKA — Centered Kernel Alignment (Kornblith et al., 2019)\n\nCKA computes similarity between neural network representations via the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between centered kernel matrices [6]. It produces a **single scalar** between 0 and 1 indicating how similar two representations are. A grep of the full paper for per-instance, individual instance, sample-level, diagnostic, data quality, noise, and label terms returned **zero matches** [6]. CKA is purely a global similarity metric with no per-instance diagnostic capability. **CRND gap: Global only; no per-instance diagnostics.**\n\n#### SVCCA — Singular Vector CCA (Raghu et al., 2017)\n\nSVCCA combines SVD and CCA to compare representations across layers and networks [7]. It is invariant to affine transforms and computationally efficient. However, like CKA, it produces global similarity scores between representation spaces. **CRND gap: Global only; no per-instance diagnostics.**\n\n#### PWCCA — Projection-Weighted CCA (Morcos et al., 2018)\n\nPWCCA extends SVCCA by weighting canonical directions according to their contribution to original representations [8]. It addresses the signal-to-noise problem in SVCCA but remains a global metric producing a single weighted mean canonical correlation. **CRND gap: Global only; no per-instance diagnostics.**\n\n#### tRSA — Topological RSA (Lin, 2024)\n\nThe most recent entry in representation comparison, tRSA applies nonlinear monotonic transforms to representational dissimilarities to emphasize local topology while retaining geometry [9]. It extends classical RSA (Kriegeskorte, 2008) with topological structure. However, tRSA compares **representational dissimilarity matrices** as wholes — it does not provide per-instance diagnostics identifying specific problematic instances [9]. **CRND gap: Matrix-level comparison; no per-instance diagnostics.**\n\n#### NNGS — Nearest Neighbor Graph Similarity (2024)\n\n**This is the closest conceptual relative to CRND.** NNGS measures embedding space similarity using the average Jaccard similarity between corresponding nodes of k-neighborhood-induced graphs [10]. It computes per-node Jaccard overlap of k-NN sets across different embeddings — the same mathematical building block CRND uses. However, NNGS **averages** these per-node scores into a single global similarity metric [10]. A grep of the paper for per-instance diagnostics, noise, label, anomaly, outlier, data quality, and flagging terms found only statistical noise (white noise perturbation experiments), not label noise detection [10]. **NNGS uses the same mechanism (Jaccard of k-NN sets) but for a completely different purpose (global embedding comparison) and does NOT provide per-instance diagnostics for data quality.** CRND gap: Aggregated to global; not used for instance-level diagnostics or noise detection.\n\n---\n\n### Stream 3: Neighbor-Based Label Noise Detection\n\n#### NCR — Learning with Neighbor Consistency (Iscen et al., CVPR 2022)\n\nNCR enforces similarity among neighbors by minimizing the distance between logits of examples with similar feature representations [11]. It assigns lower confidence to mislabeled examples through a regularization term interpretable as inductive label propagation [11]. NCR operates in a **single learned feature space** (the model's own representation). A grep for multiple/cross/different representations returned only one match about class distribution separation, not multi-representation analysis [11]. **CRND gap: Single feature space; supervised (requires training); not cross-representation.**\n\n#### WANN — Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (Di Salvo et al., TMLR 2025)\n\n**WANN is the closest direct competitor to CRND.** WANN introduces a reliability score η, computed as the inverse of the minimum number of samples needed for correct prediction, to guide weighted k-NN voting [12]. It operates on image embeddings from a **single pre-trained foundation model** (DINOv2 ViT-L/14 achieving best results) [12]. A grep for multiple/cross/different representations found only Table 1 showing performance across **eight different feature spaces independently** — WANN evaluates embeddings one at a time, never comparing neighborhoods across them [12]. **Critical distinction: WANN detects noise where a single embedding's k-NN disagrees with a label; CRND detects instances where k-NN neighborhoods are inconsistent ACROSS independent embeddings, which is a fundamentally different signal.** CRND can detect noise that WANN misses when a noisy label happens to be consistent within one embedding but inconsistent across embeddings.\n\n#### Dataset Cartography (Swayamdipta et al., EMNLP 2020)\n\nDataset Cartography maps instances into confidence × variability space using training dynamics across epochs [13]. It identifies easy-to-learn, hard-to-learn, and ambiguous instances. It is **per-instance** and provides diagnostics, but requires **model training** (multiple epochs) and operates within a **single model's representation** [13]. It is not unsupervised, not cross-representation, and computationally expensive. **CRND gap: Requires training; single model; supervised.**\n\n#### Zero-Shot Data Maps (Basile et al., EMNLP 2023 Findings)\n\nZero-Shot Data Maps extend Dataset Cartography by using ensemble variance of zero-shot models constructed with semantically equivalent label descriptions [14]. This eliminates training but still uses **a single type of representation** (bi-encoder embeddings) with variability only from label description changes [14]. **CRND gap: Single representation type; variability from prompt engineering, not independent feature spaces.**\n\n#### cleanlab / Confident Learning (Northcutt et al., JAIR 2021)\n\nConfident Learning estimates the joint distribution of noisy and true labels through the confident joint, providing per-instance noise identification [15]. It is model-agnostic in the sense that it works with any classifier's predicted probabilities, but it requires **trained model predictions** as input. It does not compare neighborhoods or representations — it analyzes predicted probability distributions [15]. **CRND gap: Requires trained predictions; probability-based, not neighborhood-based; single model.**\n\n#### AUM — Area Under the Margin (Pleiss et al., NeurIPS 2020)\n\nAUM quantifies the average difference between assigned and highest non-assigned logit values over training epochs [16]. It identifies mislabeled data by analyzing training dynamics. It requires **full model training** and operates in a **single model's output space** [16]. **CRND gap: Requires training; single model; not cross-representation.**\n\n#### CORES² (Cheng et al., ICLR 2021)\n\nCORES² (COnfidence REgularized Sample Sieve) handles instance-dependent label noise with theoretical guarantees [17]. It regularizes classifier confidence to safely sieve corrupted examples. It requires **training** and operates in a **single representation** [17]. **CRND gap: Requires training; single representation; supervised.**\n\n#### Deep k-NN for Noisy Labels (Bahri et al., ICML 2020)\n\nDeep k-NN uses k-nearest neighbor filtering on the logit layer of a preliminary model to remove mislabeled training data [18]. It is neighborhood-based and per-instance but operates in a **single learned embedding** (the model's logit layer) and requires a **trained model** [18]. **CRND gap: Single embedding; requires trained model; not cross-representation.**\n\n---\n\n### Stream 4: Ecological Niche Overlap Transfer to ML\n\n#### Schoener's D — Never Applied to ML\n\nSchoener's D was created by Schoener (1968) for quantifying overlap in prey items between anole species [19]. It measures similarity between discretized probability functions on a 0-1 scale. The Broennimann et al. (2012) PCA-env framework operationalized Schoener's D for modern ecological niche modeling by projecting occurrence data into PCA-reduced environmental space and computing kernel density estimates [20].\n\n**Critical negative result:** Extensive searching for Schoener's D applied to machine learning, classification, neural networks, or deep learning returned **zero relevant results** [19]. The Lorena et al. (2019) complexity survey [3] and Santos et al. (2022) class overlap survey [5] — the two most comprehensive ML data complexity surveys — contain no mention of Schoener's D, ecological metrics, or niche overlap. This confirms **genuine Level 3 cross-domain transfer novelty**: adapting an ecological niche overlap metric to measure class distribution overlap in ML feature spaces has not been done before.\n\n#### Hellinger Distance — Used in ML but NOT via Ecological Framework\n\nWhile Hellinger distance itself is used in ML (decision trees, feature selection, distribution comparison), it is applied as a standard statistical divergence measure [21]. It has **never** been combined with the Broennimann PCA-env kernel density framework or used with Schoener's D for ML class overlap measurement. CRND's transfer of the full ecological niche analysis methodology (kernel density estimation in PCA-env space + Schoener's D) to ML is novel.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Novelty Threats Investigated\n\n#### NNGS (2024) — Partial Overlap, Different Purpose\n\nNNGS computes Jaccard similarity of k-NN neighborhoods across different embeddings [10] — the same mathematical operation underlying CRND. However, NNGS uses this for **global embedding comparison** (averaging per-node Jaccard into a scalar), not per-instance diagnostics. It has no concept of data quality, noise detection, or instance flagging. CRND's contribution is using per-instance neighborhood dissonance as a diagnostic signal, not just an averaged similarity metric.\n\n#### MODGD — Multi-View Outlier Detection (2023)\n\nMulti-view Outlier Detection via Graphs Denoising constructs graphs per view and identifies outliers through graph denoising [22]. However, it detects **attribute outliers** (anomalous feature values) and **class outliers** (inconsistent cluster membership across views) using graph-level analysis, not Jaccard overlap of k-NN sets. Its mechanism is fundamentally different from CRND's neighborhood comparison approach.\n\n#### TMNR² — Trusted Multi-View Learning (2024)\n\nTMNR² uses K neighbors for noise identification within each view and generates pseudo-labels from neighboring information [23]. However, it does NOT compute Jaccard overlap of neighbor sets across views. It uses evidence-label consistency from Dirichlet-based uncertainty, not neighborhood overlap. The neighboring information is within-view, not cross-view.\n\n#### NIRNL — Neighbor-Aware Instance Refining (2024)\n\nNIRNL retrieves nearest neighbors and evaluates their consistency with ground-truth labels in a shared semantic space [24]. It operates in a **single** cross-modal embedding space, not across independent representations. It is supervised (requires labels for consistency evaluation).\n\n#### 2025 Benchmark Survey\n\nA comprehensive 2025 benchmark of 34 mislabeled data identification methods [25] contains zero matches for cross-representation, multiple representations, different feature spaces, or multi-view approaches. This confirms the gap persists in the latest survey literature.\n\n#### 2024 Mislabeled Detection Survey\n\nThe modular framework survey of mislabeled detection methods (arxiv 2410.15772) [26] parameterized by 4 building blocks also contains zero matches for cross-representation concepts. All surveyed methods operate within single representations.\n\n---\n\n### Master Novelty Positioning Table\n\n| Method | Year | Per-Instance | Multi-Rep | Neighbor | Unsupervised | Model-Agnostic | CRND Gap |\n|--------|------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|\n| Ho & Basu N1-N3 | 2002 | Partial | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Single rep |\n| Smith kDN | 2014 | Yes | No* | Yes | No** | No | Single rep, varies algos |\n| Lorena survey | 2019 | Partial | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Single rep |\n| Arruda/PyHard | 2020 | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Single rep |\n| CKA | 2019 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Global only |\n| SVCCA | 2017 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Global only |\n| PWCCA | 2018 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Global only |\n| tRSA | 2024 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Global only |\n| NNGS | 2024 | Averaged | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Averaged to global |\n| NCR | 2022 | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Single rep, supervised |\n| WANN eta | 2024 | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Single rep |\n| Cartography | 2020 | Yes | No | No | No | No | Single model, needs training |\n| Zero-Shot Maps | 2023 | Yes | No | No | Yes | Partial | Single rep type |\n| cleanlab | 2021 | Yes | No | No | No | Partial | Probability-based |\n| AUM | 2020 | Yes | No | No | No | No | Needs training |\n| CORES2 | 2021 | Yes | No | No | No | No | Needs training |\n| Deep k-NN | 2020 | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Single embed, needs training |\n| MODGD | 2023 | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes | Yes | Graph-based, not k-NN Jaccard |\n| TMNR2 | 2024 | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Within-view neighbors |\n| NIRNL | 2024 | Yes | No*** | Yes | No | No | Shared space, supervised |\n| **CRND** | **2025** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Unique conjunction** |\n\n*Smith et al. varies classifiers, not representations. **Requires cross-validation. ***Single shared embedding space.\n\n---\n\n### CRND Unique Position Statement\n\nCRND is the **first method** to provide **per-instance, cross-representation, neighborhood-based, unsupervised, and model-agnostic** data diagnostics by computing Jaccard overlap of k-NN sets across independently constructed feature spaces. The closest competitor in noise detection (WANN) operates in a single embedding; the closest in mechanism (NNGS) averages to a global metric without diagnostics. The transfer of Schoener's D from ecological niche overlap to ML class overlap measurement represents a genuine Level 3 cross-domain innovation with no prior precedent in either the ML complexity literature or the class overlap survey literature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Baselines for Experiments (Top 4)\n\n1. **WANN eta** (Di Salvo et al., TMLR 2025): Closest competitor. Implementation: github.com/francescodisalvo05/wann-noisy-labels. Compute reliability score per instance using DINOv2 embeddings. Compare: CRND should detect noise WANN misses when representations disagree.\n\n2. **kDN** (Smith et al., 2014): Classic instance hardness. Implementation: deslib Python package or PyHard. Compute k=5 disagreeing neighbor percentage per instance. Compare: kDN in single space vs CRND across spaces.\n\n3. **Dataset Cartography** (Swayamdipta et al., 2020): Training-dynamics baseline. Implementation: github.com/allenai/cartography. Compute confidence and variability across epochs. Compare: Training-dependent vs CRND's training-free approach.\n\n4. **cleanlab** (Northcutt et al., 2021): Industry-standard noise detection. Implementation: pip install cleanlab. Use CL.find_label_issues(). Compare: Probability-based vs neighborhood-based detection.\n\n---\n\n### Confidence Assessment\n\n**High confidence (95%):** No existing method combines all 5 CRND criteria. This is supported by zero matches across two comprehensive surveys (Lorena 2019, Santos 2022), two recent benchmarks (2024 mislabeled survey, 2025 benchmark), and detailed analysis of 20+ individual methods.\n\n**High confidence (90%):** Schoener's D has never been applied to ML class overlap. Extensive search across ML literature, complexity surveys, and class overlap surveys yielded zero results.\n\n**Moderate confidence (80%):** NNGS (2024) is correctly characterized as global-only. While it computes per-node Jaccard scores internally, the paper only uses aggregated metrics. A future extension of NNGS to per-instance diagnostics would be a novelty threat.\n\n**What would change this assessment:** Discovery of a method that computes Jaccard overlap of k-NN sets across independent feature spaces AND uses the per-instance scores for data quality diagnostics. No such method was found.",

  "follow_up_questions": [
    "How does CRND's detection performance scale with the number of independent representations compared (2 vs 3 vs 5+), and is there a diminishing returns threshold?",
    "Can NNGS (2024) be straightforwardly extended to per-instance diagnostics, and would that constitute a concurrent/independent novelty threat to CRND?",
    "What specific noise patterns does CRND detect that WANN misses (e.g., instances where one embedding's neighborhood supports the label but another's contradicts it)?",
    "How should Schoener's D be adapted for high-dimensional ML feature spaces where the PCA-env 2D projection may lose critical information?",
    "What is the computational complexity of CRND's cross-representation Jaccard computation compared to WANN's single-embedding reliability score, and does it scale to datasets with >100K instances?",
    "Are there multi-modal contrastive learning methods (e.g., CLIP-style) that implicitly enforce cross-representation neighborhood consistency during training, potentially making CRND's post-hoc analysis redundant for models trained with such objectives?"
